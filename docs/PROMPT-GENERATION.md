# Complete Modernization Prompt Set
## Initial Project Assessment & Setup
I have a Node.js/TypeScript Fastify service that needs modernization. Please audit the current setup and identify any deprecated configurations, outdated dependencies, or configuration mismatches. Focus on:
- Fastify configuration and logging setup
- OpenTelemetry tracing configuration
- ESLint and linting setup
- Package dependencies and versions
- TypeScript configuration compliance

## OpenTelemetry Modernization
Please modernize the OpenTelemetry setup for this service:

## Development Environment Setup
Please set up a proper development environment configuration:
- Create separate .env.dev file with development-specific settings (debug logging, dev service names)
- Update package.json dev script to use .env.dev automatically
- Add debug script for Node.js inspector support
- Configure different log levels and service names for dev vs production
## VS Code Debugging Configuration

- Use proper semantic conventions (ATTR_SERVICE_NAME, ATTR_SERVICE_VERSION)
- Set up trace context injection in logs
- Configure OTLP exporter with proper error handling
- Add graceful shutdown for tracing SDK
## Functional Error Handling Setup
Please set up neverthrow for functional error handling:
- Install and configure neverthrow package
- Add ESLint rules to enforce Result<T, E> usage
- Configure lint rules to prevent unsafe unwrap operations
- Set up proper error handling patterns throughout the codebase
- Ensure type safety with functional error handling
## Production-Ready Configuration
Please ensure the service is production-ready:
- Set up proper environment variable configuration with zod-config
- Configure structured logging with Pino
- Add health check endpoints
- Set up graceful shutdown handlers
- Configure proper TypeORM settings for development vs production
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation

# All-in-One Master Prompt (For Complete Setup)
Please modernize this Node.js/TypeScript Fastify service to production standards:

1. **OpenTelemetry**: Migrate from deprecated Jaeger to OTLP HTTP, configure NodeSDK with Pino/Fastify instrumentation, use resourceFromAttributes with semantic conventions

2. **ESLint**: Upgrade to v9 flat config, add neverthrow enforcement, configure TypeScript parsing

3. **Development Setup**: Create .env.dev, update dev scripts, add VS Code debug configurations with TypeScript support

4. **Docker**: Add Adminer, configure Jaeger for OTLP (4317/4318), set up health checks

5. **TypeScript**: Fix deprecated imports (assert â†’ with), ensure verbatimModuleSyntax compliance

6. **Environment Config**: Use zod-config for type-safe environment variables, separate dev/prod settings

7. **Error Handling**: Set up neverthrow with lint enforcement for functional error handling

8. **Logging**: Configure structured Pino logging with trace context injection

9. **Entity Architecture**: Extract BaseEntity with common fields, standardize naming conventions, use TypeORM UUID generation

10. **Type System**: Simplify by removing branded types while maintaining UUID validation and type safety

11. **Test Organization**: Move test utilities to proper structure, add development testing scripts

12. **Code Structure**: Implement consistent naming patterns and eliminate technical debt

Follow modern Node.js 22, TypeScript ES2022, and Fastify 5.x best practices throughout.

# Master Refactoring Prompt (For Existing Projects)
Please refactor this existing Node.js/TypeScript Fastify service for better maintainability and modern standards:

1. **Entity Refactoring**: Extract BaseEntity, standardize naming (kebab-case), implement TypeORM UUID generation

2. **Type System**: Maintain simple string-based UUID types with runtime validation (branded types were briefly explored but removed)

3. **Test Infrastructure**: Organize test utilities in proper directory structure, add development testing scripts

4. **Code Quality**: Ensure consistent naming conventions, eliminate duplicate code, improve maintainability

5. **Documentation**: Update all documentation to reflect architectural changes and improvements

This should result in cleaner, more maintainable code with the same functionality and comprehensive test coverage.

# Entity Refactoring & Code Structure Improvements

## Base Entity Extraction
Please extract common entity fields into a reusable base entity:
- Create a BaseEntity class with common fields (id, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Update all entities to extend BaseEntity and remove duplicate fields
- Ensure TypeORM decorators are properly configured
- Update all imports and ensure type safety
- Maintain database compatibility with existing schema

## Entity Naming Convention Standardization
Please standardize entity and service naming conventions:
- Rename all entities to use the format: name-extendedname.entity.ts
- Rename all services to use the format: name-extendedname.service.ts
- Update all imports and references throughout the codebase
- Ensure consistent naming patterns across the project
- Update test files to match new naming conventions

## UUID Generation Strategy Migration
Please migrate from manual UUID generation to TypeORM-managed UUIDs:
- Change from @PrimaryColumn('uuid') to @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')
- Remove manual UUID generation lifecycle hooks (@BeforeInsert)
- Update entity base class to use database-generated UUIDs
- Preserve UUID validation utilities for runtime validation
- Ensure all tests continue to pass with the new approach
- Verify database compatibility between PostgreSQL and SQLite

## Branded Types Implementation and Removal
Please implement and then remove branded types for entity IDs:

### Phase 1: Add Branded Types
- Add branded type definitions for entity IDs (e.g., UserId, GitHubOrganizationId)
- Create utility functions for branded type conversion and validation
- Update all service methods to use branded types for type safety
- Update routes to convert string IDs to branded types with validation
- Add comprehensive tests for branded type utilities

### Phase 2: Remove Branded Types
- Remove all branded type definitions from entities
- Update service methods to use plain string types
- Remove branded type conversion utilities
- Update routes to use direct UUID validation instead of branded type conversion
- Remove branded type utility files and tests
- Simplify type system while maintaining UUID validation

## Test Organization and Utilities
Please organize test utilities and improve test structure:
- Move development testing scripts to src/test/utils/ directory
- Create proper documentation for test utilities
- Add npm scripts for easy access to test utilities (test:db, test:startup)
- Update package.json with convenient test utility commands
- Ensure test utilities are properly documented and organized
- Clean up root directory by moving test files to appropriate locations

## Database Connection and Startup Testing
Please create utilities for testing database connectivity and application startup:
- Create a PostgreSQL connection test script that verifies database connectivity
- Create a server startup test that validates configuration loading and basic server functionality
- Include proper error handling and informative output
- Make utilities easily runnable via npm scripts
- Document usage and purpose of each utility script

# Recent Refactoring Summary Prompts
