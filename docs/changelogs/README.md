# AI Changes Changelog Index

This directory contains individual changelog files for each AI chat session to maintain visibility and accountability of automated modifications.

## How to Use
- Each AI session creates a new changelog file with format: `YYYY-MM-DD_session-description.md`
- Files are organized chronologically for easy tracking
- Each file contains detailed changes made during that specific session
