## Dashboard Organization Structure

### Directory Layout
```
grafana/
├── dashboards/
│   ├── application/          # Application-specific dashboards
│   ├── infrastructure/       # Infrastructure and system dashboards
│   ├── observability/        # Observability stack dashboards
│   └── business/            # Business metrics dashboards
├── provisioning/
│   ├── dashboards/          # Dashboard provisioning configuration
│   └── datasources/         # Datasource provisioning configuration
└── alerting/
    ├── rules/               # Alert rule definitions
    └── notifications/       # Notification channel configurations
```

### Dashboard Categories

#### Application Performance Dashboards
- **API Performance**: Request rates, response times, error rates by endpoint
- **Database Metrics**: Query performance, connection pools, slow queries
- **GitHub API Integration**: Rate limits, API response times, error tracking
- **TypeORM Metrics**: Entity operations, transaction performance, migration status
- **Fastify Metrics**: Route performance, plugin execution times, memory usage

#### Infrastructure Dashboards
- **Container Health**: CPU, memory, disk usage for all containers
- **Network Performance**: Inter-service communication, latency, throughput
- **Resource Utilization**: System resources, container limits, scaling metrics
- **Docker Compose Services**: Service status, restart counts, health checks

#### Observability Stack Dashboards
- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Ingestion rates, processing latency, export errors
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Storage usage, query performance, scraping status
- **Grafana Tempo**: Trace ingestion, storage usage, query performance
- **Loki Logs**: Log ingestion rates, query performance, retention status

#### Business Metrics Dashboards
- **Contributor Analytics**: Active contributors, contribution patterns, geographic distribution
- **Repository Metrics**: Commit frequency, pull request analytics, issue tracking
- **Organization Insights**: Team productivity, project velocity, code quality metrics
- **GitHub API Usage**: API consumption patterns, rate limit utilization, cost tracking

## Key Guidelines Established

### Development Standards
- **Naming Conventions**: Descriptive, kebab-case names for consistency
- **Unique UIDs**: Prevent dashboard conflicts through unique identification
- **Version Control**: All dashboard JSON files stored in version control
- **Environment Variables**: Use Grafana variables for environment-specific values
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified color schemes, fonts, and layout patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility across different screen sizes

### Dashboard Content Requirements
- **Overview Panels**: High-level KPIs and summary metrics
- **Drill-down Capability**: Links to detailed views for investigation
- **Time Range Controls**: Appropriate time range selectors
- **Annotations**: Deployment, incident, and major event markers
- **Documentation**: Panel descriptions and dashboard documentation
- **Thresholds**: Warning and critical thresholds for metrics

### Alert Configuration Strategy
- **Critical Alerts**: Application down, database failures, API errors > 5%
- **Warning Alerts**: High response times, resource utilization > 80%, rate limits
- **Information Alerts**: Deployment notifications, scaling events, configuration changes
- **Alert Routing**: Different notification channels for different severities
- **Escalation Policies**: Defined escalation procedures for unacknowledged alerts

### Quality Assurance Process
- **Data Validation**: Verify all panels display correct data from datasources
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure dashboards load quickly with large datasets
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Test functionality across different browsers
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Verify mobile device compatibility
- **User Acceptance**: Gather feedback and iterate based on user needs

## Benefits of Comprehensive Dashboard Management

### Operational Benefits
- **Unified Monitoring**: Single pane of glass for all observability data
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Early detection of issues through proper alerting
- **Faster Troubleshooting**: Well-organized dashboards enable quick problem identification
- **Performance Optimization**: Regular monitoring of application and infrastructure performance

### Development Benefits
- **Code Quality**: Dashboard-as-code approach with version control
- **Consistency**: Standardized dashboard design and content patterns
- **Maintainability**: Clear organization and documentation for easy maintenance
- **Collaboration**: Shared understanding through well-designed visualizations

### Business Benefits
- **Visibility**: Clear insights into contributor metrics and business KPIs
- **Decision Making**: Data-driven decisions based on comprehensive analytics
- **Accountability**: Track progress and performance against business objectives
- **ROI Tracking**: Monitor return on investment for development efforts

## Next Steps
1. Create initial dashboard structure under `grafana/dashboards/`
2. Develop core application performance dashboards
3. Implement Grafana provisioning configuration
4. Set up alerting rules for critical metrics
5. Establish dashboard review and maintenance procedures

## Verification Required
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboard directory structure
- [ ] Develop initial set of required dashboards
- [ ] Configure Grafana provisioning for automatic deployment
- [ ] Set up alerting rules and notification channels
- [ ] Test dashboard functionality and performance
- [ ] Validate alert configuration and escalation procedures

## Notes
- Dashboard organization follows domain-driven design principles
- All dashboards should be stored as JSON files in version control
- Provisioning approach enables infrastructure-as-code for dashboards
- Alert configuration covers critical application and infrastructure metrics
- Quality assurance process ensures dashboard reliability and performance
